# Python-beginner-projects
Projects created in Python as beginner level
These projects were projects I had to do while learning Python from the Python Institue and Udemy.
Some projects came as a  template or skeleton code while others were created from scratch.
I will be adding more projects as I learn more in the pursuit of my interest and to get a job as a software devloper
